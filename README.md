A project demonstrating the effects of variable change in the famous Monty Hall Problem

If you are unfamilar with the Monty Hall problem you can watch these short videos

The purpose of this software is to indeed demonstrate that when you switch doors your chances of getting the car are 66.6%.
Most people would assume that the chance is 50%, however this is incorrect.  

In this short project I try to mimic the Monty Hall scenario by having a random number generated between 0-2 and another random number generated to demonstrate where the car is.
